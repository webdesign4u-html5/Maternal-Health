				  <h3>This Article is will guide you about the Diet a pregnent women should have in the Sixth month of pregnancy.</h3>
				  <ul><h4>
					<li>Protein:
					   This important nutrient should be a part of your daily diet. However, you should avoid fatty fish and the skin, also meat fat.
					   It is in fact a good idea to avoid too much meat, and especially red meat.
					      You should go for : Lean meat, White fish, Eggs, Black beans, Tofu</li>
					<li>Fruits:
					   There is nothing like fresh fruits to refresh and revitalize you. The goodness that they pack in makes them the best food to eat while you are pregnant.
					   You should go for : Bananas, Grapes, Kiwis, Apples, Pears, Clementine, Oranges</li>
					<li>Dairy Products:
					   If you avoided dairy products before your pregnancy, now is the perfect time to indulge! The calcium you take in will aid in making sure that your baby’s bones grow strong.
					   If you are worried about gaining excess weight, you can opt for skimmed or low-fat dairy products. You do not need to worry as these are still rich in calcium as well as protein.
					   However, make sure you check with your doctor, as some women develop lactose intolerance during this stage, while some doctors may ask you to stay off skimmed milk completely.
					   You should go for : Yoghurt, Cheese, Milk</li>
					<li>Fluids:
					   You should drink plenty of water and fruit juices during this stage of your pregnancy. 
					   Experts recommend 6 to 8 glasses of fluids every day to replenish your body and also give your baby essential minerals that are present in water.
					   Fresh fruit juices will give you the necessary nutrients to have a healthy pregnancy and baby!</li>
					<li>Carbohydrates:
					   A portion or two a day of carbohydrates is recommended during pregnancy. But keep in mind that this depends on how much weight you have gained.
					   You should go for : Potatoes, Pasta, Sweet corn, Seeds and nuts, Oats
					   These are some of the foods that are rich on ‘carbs’ and healthy too.</li>
					<li>Vegetables:
					   The goodness of vegetables is no secret and during your 6th month of pregnancy, they are an even more important part of your diet.
					   You should go for : Beetroot, Cabbage, Asparagus, Spinach, Carrots, Pumpkin, Turnip, Eggplant/Brinjal, Green beans, Tomatoes</li>

					<h1><b>What To Avoid?</b></h1>
						 <h4>Many women often have cravings for rather unhealthy foods while they are pregnant.
						 While it is okay to indulge moderately in some junk food, there are certain foods that should be avoided at all costs while you are pregnant, especially up to your 6th month.
					</h4>
					<ul><h4>
						<li>Spicy Food:
						   There will be times when you want to eat something hot and spicy; however, it is best to avoid anything that is too spicy. 
						   It can cause your stomach to burn and cause indigestion and great discomfort. It is also not one of the best flavors to give your baby, so curb your cravings for anything too spicy.</li>
						<li>Caffeine:
						   It is best to avoid caffeinated beverages such as coffee and aerated drinks. 
						   It is a much healthier option to drink herbal tea as it will sooth and calm you, which is exactly what you need while you are pregnant. 
						   Then again, check with your doctor, as some women are put off green or herbal tea during pregnancy.</li>
						<li>Alcohol And Tobacco:
						   It is no secret that you need to completely stay away from alcohol and tobacco while you are pregnant. 
						   The damage done to your baby can be irreparable, even fatal, when you smoke or drink during pregnancy.</li>
						<li>Raw Seafood:
						   You may have a sudden hankering for sushi but avoid it at all costs! 
						   As raw fish carry high level of methylmercury, that can cause food-borne diseases like listeriosis which can be dangerous for your unborn baby.</li>
						<li>Undercooked Meat:
						   Always make sure that you cook your meat well as the bacteria mentioned above can be present in meat that is undercooked.
						   If you are cooking meat for a meal, take care to cook it well so that you can digest it easily and also avoid the risk of listeriosis. Try and avoid eating meat outside.</li>
						<li>Non-Pasteurized Cheeses:
						   Avoid soft cheeses that are not pasteurized and stick to hard cheeses only during your pregnancy, especially during your 6th month. 
						   Disease-causing bacteria can also be present in this type of cheese so omit it from your diet.</li>
