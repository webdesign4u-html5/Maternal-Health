					<h3>This Article will guide you about the Diet a pregnent women should have in the Third month of pregnancy.</h3>
					<ul>
							Diet we should have are:
							<h3> Vegetables </h3>
								<li> Healthy food for a 3-months-pregnant lady should include at least 3 cups of vegetables per day. 
								 Choose different coloured vegetables and mix them up to ensure you get a wide range of nutrients and tastes.
								 Examples include kale, spinach, broccoli, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, carrots, pumpkin, bell peppers, corn, eggplant, cabbage, drumstick, etc.</li>
							<h3>Carbohydrates</h3>
								 <li>Carbohydrates provide the energy source for our body. 
								 Complex carbohydrates are found in foods like whole grains, legumes, and starchy vegetables like potatoes and sweet potatoes take longer for our body to break-down and metabolise.
								 This helps in providing steady amounts of energy. Simple carbohydrates from natural sources like fruits and vegetables that contain fibre are also good for your growing baby.
								 Avoid simple carbs found in processed foods like refined flour, cookies, and cakes.</li>
							<h3>Fresh Fruits</h3>
								 <li>Fruits contain a wide range of nutrients and antioxidants that are essential for the baby’s healthy growth and development.
								 Fresh fruits are a better source of nutrients than fruit juices and canned or frozen fruit.
								 Include plenty of muskmelon, avocados, pomegranate, bananas, guava, oranges, sweet limes, strawberries, and apples in your diet.</li>
							<h3> Vitamin B6-Rich Foods</h3>
								 <li>The morning sickness may peak at week 9 and will start decreasing by the end of week 12. Vitamin B6 helps combat nausea and vomiting.
								 Examples of vitamin B6-rich foods include lean meats, poultry, eggs, citrus fruits, legumes, soybeans, nuts, seeds, and avocados.</li>
							<h3> Folate-Rich Foods</h3>
								 <li>Folate or folic acid is very important for the proper development of the baby’s brain and spinal cord.
								 Even if you are taking folic acid supplements, it is good to include natural sources of folate-rich foods in your diet.
								 Examples of folate-rich foods are broccoli, citrus fruits, beans, peas, lentils, avocado, Brussels sprouts, okra, asparagus, and dark green leafy vegetables like spinach and kale.</li>
							<h3>Omega-3-Rich Foods</h3>
								 <li>Omega-3 fatty acids are essential nutrients that are necessary for the healthy development of the eyes and brain in the baby.
                                 Examples : soybeans, canola oil, walnuts, chia seeds, flaxseeds, salmon, mackerel, sardines, and wild rice.</li>
                                 </ul>

                  <h3>The first trimester of pregnancy, which begins on the day of conception and ends with week 12, is crucial and challenging. You will gain weight, feel sluggish, experience morning sickness along with other symptoms. During this stage, the fetus grows quickly and several vital organs including the nervous system, spine, and digestive tract start to develop. The fetus also attains a human form by the end of the trimester.

                  To ensure healthy fetal development during this sensitive phase, you need to adopt a healthy diet and lifestyle. In this MomJunction post, we list down the essential precautions you need to take to stay healthy during the first three months of pregnancy.</h3>
                  
                
                  <h3>Follow these precautions in the first trimester to avoid several pregnancy complications.</h3>
                  <ul>
                  <h3> Stay hydrated</h3>
                  <li>You will need more fluids during pregnancy as the blood volume increases to support the oxygen and nutrient requirements of the fetus. The sudden changes in the body will increase the demand for fluid intake. You should consider having lots of water, fresh juices, and smoothies to remain hydrated at this time .</li>
                  
                  <h3>Take prenatal vitamins</h3>
                  <li>Take prenatal vitamins as suggested by your doctor. The early pregnancy period is crucial for both the mother and the fetus. It is essential that you take supplements for folic acid, which is essential to prevent birth defects, and iron that prevents pregnancy anemia.</li>
                  
                  <h3>Quit smoking</h3>
                  <li>If you are a habitual smoker, now is the time to quit. Smoking increases the risk of several complications such as low immunity, low-birth weight, premature labor, miscarriage, and ectopic pregnancy . There is also a risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) with second-hand smoking. Therefore, say no to tobacco and avoid passive smoking for a healthy pregnancy.</li>
                  
                    <h3>Quit alcohol and cut down caffeine</h3>
                  <li>Like tobacco, alcohol and caffeine also put the mother and the fetus at risk. Alcohol is known to cause learning disabilities and affect the cognitive functioning of the fetus. Too much caffeine is associated with premature labor and congenital disabilities. Limit colas, sodas, chocolates, green and black tea as they contain excess caffeine.</li>
                  
                  <h3>Watch your food</h3>
                  <li>Make healthy food choices and follow a balanced diet. Keeping your dietary habits in check also helps you manage your weight effectively.</li>
                  
                  <li>Include more nuts and seeds to increase your intake of omega-3s, which are required for the development of brain, eyes, and nerves of your baby.</li>
                  <li>Consume egg yolk, milk, tuna, salmon, and fish liver oil that are rich in vitamin D. Also, get more sunlight exposure.</li>
                  <li>Increase your calcium intake by including broccoli, spinach, and tofu besides dairy products to your diet.</li>
                  <li>Include all food groups; talk to your doctor about calorie intake and plan your diet accordingly.</li>
                  <li>Avoid processed foods as they contain traces of sodium nitrates that affect fetal development.</li>
                  <li>Avoid preservatives and foods with synthetic colors.</li>
                  <li>Wash fruits and vegetables to remove the pesticide residue or stick to organic sources.</li>
                  
                  <h3>Fish and seafood</h3>
                  <li>Although fish and seafood are healthy sources of proteins and fats, some varieties contain high mercury levels that are dangerous for the fetus. Mercury is associated with brain damage and developmental delays in the baby. Therefore, you should consume fish with caution and also take your doctor’s advice before including it in your diet.</li>
                  
                  <li>Limit tuna, avoid king mackerel, swordfish, and tilefish.</li>
                  <li>Avoid fish caught from unknown sources
                  <li>Avoid dishes like sushi that have raw fish
                  <li>Avoid fish and seafood that are not tested by the local food safety department.</li>
                  
                  <h3>Do not miss prenatal OB/GYN visits</h3>
                  <li>Schedule a prenatal appointment soon after your pregnancy is confirmed. It is important to see a qualified gynecologist or obstetrician. Your doctor might ask about your medical history to understand your health condition better and prescribe medications accordingly. Communicate with your doctor honestly and regularly and consult them whenever you experience any pain or discomfort.</li>
                  
                  <h3>Manage your weight</h3>
                  <li>Maintain a healthy lifestyle and have a healthy BMI before trying to get pregnant. Being obese increases risks during pregnancy. Also, gaining too much weight suddenly, especially during the first trimester and commencing weeks, is harmful. Check with a dietitian or a nutritionist for a healthy diet plan.</li>
                  
                  <h3>Exercise</h3>
                  <li>Mild and moderate exercises help you stay active and keep your metabolism high. You should avoid heavy and strenuous activities such as back-bends, stretches, and advanced abdominal moves.</li>
                  
                  <li>Also, avoid exercises that need you to lie on the back, put pressure on the abdomen and those that lead to overheating and dehydration. Consult your doctor before planning to take up yoga, meditation or breathing exercises, or enroll in prenatal workout classes.</li>
                  
                  <h3>Herbs and medications</h3>
                  <li>Certain herbal supplements and medications are harmful during pregnancy. Never continue old prescriptions or pills you think are good. They may be harmful and lead to issues such as miscarriage, premature labor, and painful contractions. Always consult your doctor before taking any medication to keep yourself and the baby safe.</li>
                  
                  <h3>Avoid hot tubs and sauna baths</h3>
                  <li>Staying in high temperatures for prolonged periods will increase the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs) in the fetus. Hot tubs and saunas cause you to remain in temperatures higher than the basal body temperature. So avoid them and use heat compresses wrapped in a cloth to relieve joint pains and backaches.</li>
                  
                  <h3>Avoid strong smells</h3>
                  <li>Some pregnant women might experience a heightened sense of smell, especially in the first trimester. This could, therefore, aggravate symptoms such as morning sickness and nausea. Stay away from scents or smells that could trigger nausea or vomiting.</li>
                  
                  <h3>Limit exposure to pets</h3>
                  <li>If you have pets at home, limit contact with them as they carry harmful parasites such as Toxoplasma gondii, which is detrimental to the baby’s development. It can affect the brain causing reduced growth and eye defects in the fetus. Animal dander is also known to cause allergic reactions.</li>
                  
                  <h3>Get tested for STDs (sexually transmitted diseases)</h3>
                  <li>Pregnant women need to get screened for STDs and HIV in the early pregnancy stage. These infections will have a significant impact on the pregnancy, your health and your baby’s health too. Therefore, you should use contraceptives to avoid the risk of disease.</li>
                  
                  <h3>Is Air Travel Safe In The First Trimester?</h3>
                  <h3>Yes, it is usually safe to fly during the first trimester, but you should be aware that the likeliness of miscarriage is highest during the first trimester. Also, flying for more than four hours raises the risk of thrombosis (blood clots). Taking right precautions such as proper hydration, wearing comfortable clothing, calf exercises and walking around the airplane (if possible) helps make the journey safer.</h3>
