				  <h1>DIET</h1>
				  <h3>This Article will guide you about the Diet a pregnent women should have in the Third month of pregnancy.</h3>
				  <ul>
					<li>Calcium, vitamin D, protein, healthy fats, and folic acid are very essential things in a diet and for these yoghurt, milk, and hard cheese are a great choice.</li>
					<li>Folate or folic acid is essential for the proper development of the babyâ€™s neural tube, which later develops into the brain and spinal cord. 
						It is important to include folate-rich foods in your diet even if you are taking folic acid supplements. Examples of folate-rich foods are dark green leafy vegetables like spinach and kale,
						asparagus, b, citrus fruits, beans, peas, lentils, avocado, Brussels sprouts, and okra.</li>
					<li>Eggs are a good source of proteins, vitamins A, B2, B5, B6, B12, D, E, and K, and minerals like phosphorous, selenium, calcium and zinc.
						Poultry is also an excellent source of proteins. Eating eggs and poultry meat in the first month of pregnancy will ensure the healthy development of the foetus.</li>
					<li>Meat contains vitamin B, proteins, zinc, and iron. It is good for you and the baby if you include lean meats in your diet in the first month of pregnancy.</li>
					<li>Fish is the best example of low-fat, high-quality protein. 
						Fish is also a very good source of omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins B2, D, and E, and essential minerals like potassium, calcium, zinc, iodine, magnesium, and phosphorous.</li>
					<li>Fruits such as muskmelon, avocados, pomegranate, bananas, guava, oranges, sweet limes, strawberries,  
						and apples all contain several vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants necessary for the growth of the unborn baby.</li>
					<li>Eating plenty of colourful vegetables will ensure that you get the widest range of nutrients which are essential for your growing baby. Examples include broccoli,
						kale, spinach, carrots, pumpkin, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, bell peppers, corn, drumstick, eggplant, cabbage.</li>
					<li>Seeds and nuts are excellent sources of healthy fats, vitamins, proteins, minerals, flavonoids, and dietary fibre.
						Make sure you eat these regularly in the first month and also throughout your pregnancy for a healthy baby.</li>
				  </ul>
				  <h1>Things we should avoid</h1>
				  <ul>
					<li>Soft cheeses are made from unpasteurised milk and may contain bacteria that can cause food poisoning. Hence, it is best to avoid soft cheeses during early pregnancy.</li>
					<li>Packaged and processed foods such as juices, microwave ready meals, cakes and biscuits, condensed milk, etc. contain additives, preservatives,
						high levels of sugar and sodium, and empty calories that are not good for you or your baby.
						Some packaged foods may also contain bacteria that can cause food poisoning. Eat fresh, home-cooked meals made with natural or organic produce.</li>
					<li>Consuming too much junk food during pregnancy has been linked to mental health problems in children such as depression, anxiety, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.
						Studies have shown that these kinds of foods during pregnancy has been linked to obesity in the children.</li>
					<li>Unripe and semi-ripe papayas contain latex, which can trigger uterine contractions and cause preterm labour or even miscarriages. Avoid these during pregnancy.
						Ripe papayas, however, contain several nutrients and can be consumed in moderation if your doctor gives you the go ahead.</li>
					<li>Raw or undercooked meats can be contaminated by bacteria, salmonella, listeria, etc. which can cause serious diseases that can affect the development of the unborn child. 
						It is also better to avoid pork as even slightly undercooked pork can contain roundworm cysts that can infect the mother and cause serious health damage to the mother and the baby.</li>
					<li>Seafood contains high levels of mercury, which has been linked to foetal brain damage and developmental delays.
						Hence, avoid seafood during early pregnancy and include freshwater fish in your diet instead.</li>
					<li>Caffeine intake should be limited in early pregnancy, as it affects the nervous system and causes sleeplessness,
						irritability and nervousness if consumed excessively. It has also been linked to an increased risk of miscarriage.</li>
					<li>A pregnant woman only needs an extra 300 calories to support the growth of the unborn child.
						Consuming too many sugary foods such as sweets can cause weight gain and gestational diabetes.</li>
					<li>Alcohol is very bad for the developing foetus and can cause serious birth defects. Avoid alcohol completely during pregnancy.</li>
