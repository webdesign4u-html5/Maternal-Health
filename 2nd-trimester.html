				<h2><b>PRECAUTIONS</b></h2>
					<h3>The second trimester of your pregnancy is from week 13 to week 28 - roughly months four, five and six. As well as feeling and looking more pregnant during these weeks, you may also have more energy than you did in the first trimester
						Here are nine precautions for the second trimester so you can make the most of this feel good time.</h3>
					<ul><h4>
						<li>Stay Hydrated
							When you're feeling great in the second trimester, it can be easy to forget that your body is working hard to create your baby. It's important to give your body the fuel it needs to do that work, so Baby Center noted that you should drink lots of water and stay well hydrated during the second trimester.</li>
						<li>Adjust Your Exercise Routine
							As good as you feel now, your baby and your belly are still growing rapidly by the day. You may need to make some changes to your workout routine as the second trimester progresses to stay comfortable and safe, according to Healthline. Walking, stationary bike rides, and swimming are all great options for pregnant women.</li>
						<li>Wear Sunscreen
							If you're taking advantage of the comfortable days of your pregnancy to spend some time in the great outdoors, don't forget to slather on the sunscreen. According to Healthy Women, pregnancy hormones make your skin a bit more sensitive so it's not a fun time to accidentally get a sunburn.</li>
						<li>Check Your Medications
							The second trimester isn't totally enjoyable. According to What To Expect, some pregnant women are plagued by congestion thanks to increased blood flow. If your nose gets stuffed, be sure to check with your doctor on which medications you can take for some relief, though many over the counter pills are typically OK.</li>
						<li>Look For Signs of Gestational Diabetes
							Gestational diabetes is likely to show up during the second trimester, according to the American Pregnancy Association. Keep an eye out for symptoms like extreme thirst, tiredness, and blurred vision, and let your doctor know if you're experiencing them.</li>
						<li>Make A Dental Appointment
							Few people enjoy trips to the dentist, but good oral hygiene during pregnancy can actually help keep you and your baby safe according to Baby Center. Getting your teeth cleaned and your gums checked can help prevent dangerous infections that can spread into your bloodstream and affect your pregnancy.</li>
						<li>Keep An Eye On Your Weight
							Most women will need to bust out the maternity clothes in the second trimester, when weight gain starts to speed up. According to Parents, you'll typically gain about a pound a week during the second trimester. If your gain is significantly higher or lower than that, you might want to check in with your doctor.</li>
