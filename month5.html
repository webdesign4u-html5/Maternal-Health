					<h3>This Article is will guide you about the Diet a pregnent women should have in the Fifth month of pregnancy.</h3>
					<ul><h4>
						<li>Beef Up Your Fluid Intake:
							Stay hydrated at all times. Remember, you have to take care of two people now.
			   			    Drink plenty of water to avoid constipation. 
							In addition to water, consuming at least 2 glasses of milk every day will provide you with calcium and micronutrients that are vital for your baby’s healthy bone development.</li>
						<li>Eat Protein-Rich Foods:
						Proteins are the building blocks of our body. They are considered as the best 5th month pregnancy food.
						A diet rich in proteins is essential to ensure baby’s physical development is on the right course. Muscles, skin and organs need protein to grow and sustain themselves.
						Include chicken, eggs, nuts, pulses and cereal in your diet. If you are a vegetarian, you can always go for soya chunks, steamed chickpea, cottage cheese and tofu.</li>
						<li>Rely on Salad Power:
						   Salads made from raw veggies like cabbage, carrots, fresh tomatoes, rocket leaves and beet root are a great way to include minerals and fiber in your diet.
						   Avoid using salad dressings and pickled veggies like olives and capers, because they are high in sodium content. Make sure you drink plenty of water so that constipation is at bay.
						   It is suggested that pregnant women should have on an average 1 ounce of fiber per day. Excess fiber in the diet can also result in complications such as haemorrhoids.</li>
						<li>Have Some Fruits:
						   Fruits are brimming with vitamins and minerals, and they taste delicious too. You can never get bored with fruits and you never run out of choices.
						   There are apples, pears, bananas, kiwis, oranges, berries and currants to choose from. Why not blend some strawberries and yogurt and make a healthy smoothie?</li>
						<li>Eat Your Greens:
						   Eating a lot of green veggies might get boring. But do it for the sake of your little one. 
						   Include spinach, fenugreek and broccoli in your diet to fulfil the body’s need for iron. 
						   You can bake or grill the veggies to add some zing to them. You could also throw in a handful of spinach in your smoothies.</li>
						<li>The Wholesome Goodness:
						   Include whole grains in your diet in the form of flatbreads. 
						   Whole grains such as wheat, ragi, rice, corn and oats are rich in vitamin E, vitamin B complex, iron and magnesium and fulfil the growing baby’s need for energy and nourishment.</li>
